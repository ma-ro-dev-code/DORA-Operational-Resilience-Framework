# DORA – Operational Resilience & ICT Risk Governance Framework

## Overview

This repository presents a structured analytical framework translating the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) into practical governance artefacts, supervisory-style assessment tools and implementation-oriented control models.

The objective is to bridge regulatory requirements with operationally implementable ICT risk governance principles in regulated financial institutions.

## Scope

The framework covers:

- ICT governance structures and risk ownership models  
- ICT risk taxonomy and control mapping  
- Incident classification, escalation and reporting logic  
- Third-party ICT risk oversight and outsourcing controls  
- Operational resilience testing concepts and scenario modelling  
- Supervisory assessment matrix and evidence mapping approach  

The content is structured to support:

1. Financial institution implementation perspective (AIFM / asset manager context)  
2. Supervisory / regulatory assessment perspective  

## Repository Structure

/docs  
- 01_DORA_Structure_Overview.md  
- 02_Control_Objectives_and_Evidence_Map.md  
- 03_Third_Party_ICT_Oversight_Checklist.md  
- 04_Incident_Classification_and_Escalation_Model.md  
- 05_Supervisory_Assessment_Matrix.md  

/templates  
- Supervisory assessment template  
- Third-party oversight checklist  
- Incident log template  

## Methodological Approach

The framework follows a structured interpretation methodology:

- Regulatory requirement extraction  
- Risk objective mapping  
- Control principle formulation  
- Evidence expectation modelling  
- Supervisory challenge simulation  

## Status

This framework is under structured and progressive development.  
Additional analytical artefacts, matrices and scenario models will be uploaded incrementally.

## Disclaimer

This repository is an independent analytical project.  
It does not represent official regulatory guidance and does not replace applicable legal or supervisory texts.
