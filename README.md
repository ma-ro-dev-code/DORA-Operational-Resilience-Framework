# DORA – Operational Resilience & ICT Risk Framework

## Overview

This repository provides a structured analytical framework translating the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) into practical governance artefacts and supervisory-style assessment tools.

The objective is to bridge regulatory requirements with implementable control principles in regulated financial environments.

## Scope

The framework covers:

- ICT governance and risk management principles  
- Incident classification and escalation logic  
- Third-party ICT oversight and outsourcing controls  
- Operational resilience testing concepts  
- Supervisory assessment matrix and evidence mapping  

The content is structured to support both:
1. AIFM / financial institution implementation perspective  
2. Supervisory / regulatory assessment perspective
